                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p>Our system takes an image and determines the side of the image based on the marker line that the
                    user has made on their paper. It then binarizes the image so that it is easier for the computer
                    to read, and then identifies letters based on the blobs of black pixels. The program then identifies
                    the lowest point of each letter. If the lowest point of each letter is consistent throught the
                    entire sentence, the program assumes that it is computer generated text. It will then crop off
                    everything below that line (plus a buffer so that it doesn't cut off the dangling parts of letters
                    like g and p). This cropped portion will then be pasted onto a new image. This repeats for every
                    sentence in the image until there is no more text to read. In the end, you will have an image with
                    only the computer generated text in it.</p>
